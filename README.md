# GenAI

This repository documents my hands-on learning, experiments, and system-level
analysis of Generative AI.

The focus is not on model training, but on:
- understanding LLM behavior from first principles
- identifying failure modes (hallucination, drift, confidence illusion)
- translating model behavior into system and product decisions

## Repository structure

- `/memos` — polished analysis and decision memos
- `/experiments` — raw outputs and experimental logs
- `/notes` — learning notes and reflections
- `/resources` — references and reading material
